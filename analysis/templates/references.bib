	abstract = {Although the history of automated archaeological object detection in remotely sensed data is short, progress and emerging trends are evident. Among them, the shift from rule-based approaches towards machine learning methods is, at the moment, the cause for high expectations, even though basic problems, such as the lack of suitable archaeological training data are only beginning to be addressed. In a case study in the central Netherlands, we are currently developing novel methods for multi-class archaeological object detection in LiDAR data based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This research is embedded in a long-term investigation of the prehistoric landscape of our study region. We here present an innovative integrated workflow that combines machine learning approaches to automated object detection in remotely sensed data with a two-tier citizen science project that allows us to generate and validate detections of hitherto unknown archaeological objects, thereby contributing to the creation of reliable, labeled archaeological training datasets. We motivate our methodological choices in the light of current trends in archaeological prospection, remote sensing, machine learning, and citizen science, and present the first results of the implementation of the workflow in our research area.},

	abstract = {Object-based image analysis (OBIA) is a method of assessing remote sensing data that uses morphometric and spectral parameters simultaneously to identify features in remote sensing imagery. Over the past 10–15 years, OBIA methods have been introduced to detect archaeological features. Improvements in accuracy have been attained by using a greater number of morphometric variables and multiple scales of analysis. This article highlights the developments that have occurred in the application of OBIA within archaeology and argues that OBIA is both a useful and necessary tool for archaeological research. Additionally, I discuss future research paths using this method. Some of the suggestions put forth here include: pushing for multifaceted research designs utilizing OBIA and manual interpretation, using OBIA methods for directly studying landscape settlement patterns, and increasing data sharing of methods between researchers.},

The question remains how much of this actively improves on the underlying algorithm versus using it within a ‘black box’ setting. We survey across ML and CH literature to identify the theoretical changes which contribute to the algorithm and in turn them suitable for CH applications. Alternatively, and most commonly, when there are no changes, we review the CH applications, features and pre/post-processing which make the algorithm suitable for its use. We analyse the dominant divides within ML, Supervised, Semi-supervised and Unsupervised, and reflect on a variety of algorithms that have been extensively used. From such an analysis, we give a critical look at the use of ML in CH and consider why CH has only limited adoption of ML.},

We showcase a software system pipeline that results in significant savings in terms of expert productivity while missing only a small fraction of the artifacts.Our work employs artificial neural networks in conjunction with an efficient spatial segmentation procedure based on domain knowledge. Data processing is constraint by a limited amount of training labels and noisy LiDAR signals due to vegetation cover and decay of ancient structures. We aim at identifying geo-spatial areas with archeological artifacts in a supervised fashion allowing the domain expert to flexibly tune parameters based on her needs.},

	abstract = {Object-based image analysis (OBIA) is rapidly emerging as a valuable method for integrating the data processing techniques and GIS approaches classically employed in archaeology. OBIA is intended to replicate human perception by using a protocol of (semi)automated image segmentation and classification. However, the lack of a theoretical background adapted to the specificities of the archaeological discipline is still preventing researchers from finding a shared language and a common protocol of investigation necessary to allow the comparability of the results. This article discusses a series of crucial theoretical issues linked to the incompleteness and the equi-/multi-finality of the archaeological record and introduces the core concept of Diachronic Semantic Models (DhSM) as a means to integrate the long-term evolution of the archaeological landscape in the conceptual, digital and real-world frameworks of the object-based approach. We also present an assessment of the limits and potential of this method, built from a set of case studies from published and unpublished research. Finally, we propose a general workflow of an Archaeological Object-Based Image Analysis (ArchaeOBIA) project, designed for stimulating the development of an operational routine for object-based applications in archaeology.},

	abstract = {Archaeological and cultural heritage (ACH), one of the core carriers of cultural diversity on our planet, has a direct bearing on the sustainable development of mankind. Documenting and protecting ACH is the common responsibility and duty of all humanity. It is governed by UNESCO along with the scientific communities that foster and encourage the use of advanced non-invasive techniques and methods for promoting scientific research into ACH and conservation of ACH sites. The use of remote sensing, a non-destructive tool, is increasingly popular by specialists around the world as it allows fast prospecting and mapping at multiple scales, rapid analysis of multisource datasets, and dynamic monitoring of ACH sites and their surrounding environments. The cost of using remote sensing is lower or even zero in practical applications. In this review, in order to discuss the advantages of airborne and spaceborne remote sensing (ASRS), the principles that make passive (photography, multispectral and hyperspectral) and active (synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and light detection and ranging radar (LiDAR)) imaging techniques suitable for ACH applications are first summarized and pointed out; a review of ASRS and the methodologies used over the past century is then presented together with relevant highlights from well-known research projects. Selected case studies from Mediterranean regions to East Asia illustrate how ASRS can be used effectively to investigate and understand archaeological features at multiple -scales and to monitor and assess the conservation status of cultural heritage sites in the context of sustainable development. An in-depth discussion on the limitations of ASRS and associated remaining challenges is presented along with conclusions and a look at future trends.},

	abstract = {The variety and sophistication of data sources, sensors, and platforms employed in archaeological remote sensing have increased significantly over the past decade. Projects incorporating data from UAV surveys, regional and research-driven lidar surveys, the uptake of hyperspectral imaging, the launch of high-temporal revisit satellites, the advent of multi-sensor rigs for geophysical survey, and increased use of structure from motion mean that more archaeologists are engaging with remote sensing than ever. These technological advances continue to drive research in the specialist community and provide reasons for optimism about future applications, but many social and technical obstacles to the integration of remote sensing into archaeological research and heritage management remain. This article addresses the challenges of contemporary archaeological remote sensing by briefly reviewing trends and then focusing on providing a critical overview of the main structural problems. The discussion here concentrates on topics that have dominated the discourse in recent archaeological literature and featured prominently in ongoing fieldwork for the past decade across three broad segments of landscape archaeology: data collection in the field, the current state of data access and archives, and processing and interpretation.},

	abstract = {With the ever expanding quantity of high-resolution aerial and satellite imagery available to archaeologists, numerous researchers have sought to address this “big data” challenge by developing automated methods to aid in the discovery and mapping of archaeological sites and features. This paper reviews several notable efforts to create automated discovery tools, including both spectral and object-based approaches, and highlights the difficulties these projects have encountered. Arguing instead for the critically important role of a human analyst in archaeological discovery, I illustrate interim results of an ongoing project that utilizes CORONA satellite imagery to document previously unknown sites in a 300,000 km2 study area in the northern Fertile Crescent. The project is based on what I term “brute force” methods, relying on systematic exploration of imagery by trained analysts, and has now successfully created a database of more than 14,000 sites, some 10,000 of which are previously undocumented. Results of the project highlight the need for human intervention to make any archaeological discovery meaningful, suggesting that imagery analysis, like any act of archaeological investigation, requires an engaged, thoughtful and creative scholar.
         , 
            Desde la última década, la cantidad de imágenes aéreas y satelitales de alta resolución disponible a los arqueólogos ha crecido exponencialmente, y estos recursos ofrecen posibilidades enormes para el descubrimiento de elementos y sitios arqueológicos. La gran cantidad de datos aéreos y de satélite ya disponible a los arqueólogos puede ser abrumador, y esto ha causado que unos de nosotros busquemos herramientas automatizadas para poder manejar nuestra propia versión de “datos grandes.” Yo argumento que el análisis de imágenes aéreas y satelitales para encontrar evidencia de actividades culturales pasadas es tanto un arte hábil como ciencia. Es un proceso que requiere un arqueólogo empeñado, con un entendimiento de la historia del asentamiento local y las practicas de uso de terreno locales, y que pueda explorar imágenes creativamente para encontrar e interpretar elementos de posible importancia. Este es un trabajo que no puede ser automatizado, ni debería de ser, como sería la construcción de robots autónomos de excavación que hicieran nuestras propias excavaciones para nosotros. Ilustro este punto con un estudio de caso, utilizando imágenes satelitales CORONA en un esfuerzo para documentar sitios previamente no conocidos en un área de estudio de 300,000 km cuadrados en el norte de la Creciente Fértil. La base de datos resultante contiene 14,000+ sitios.},

	abstract = {Declassified CORONA satellite imagery, collected from 1960–1972 as part of the world’s first intelligence satellite program, provides nearly global, high-resolution, stereo imagery that predates many of the land-use changes seen in recent decades, and thus has proven to be an immensely valuable resource for archaeological research. While challenges involved in spatially correcting these unusual panoramic film images has long served as a stumbling block to researchers, an online tool called “Sunspot” now offers a straightforward process for efficient and accurate orthorectification of CORONA, helping to unlock the potential of this historical imagery for global-scale archaeological prospection. With these new opportunities come significant new challenges in how best to search through large imagery datasets like that offered by CORONA. In contrast to currently popular trends in archaeological remote sensing that seek to employ either automated, machine learning-based approaches, or alternatively, crowd-sourced approaches to assist in the identification of ancient sites and features, this paper argues for systematic, intensive, and expert-led “brute force” methods. Results from a project that has sought to map all sites and related features across a large study in the northern Fertile Crescent illustrate how an expert-led analysis may be the best means of generating nuanced, contextual understandings of complex archaeological landscapes.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the on-going research related to remote sensing archaeology in Europe, since the launch in 1999 of the first high resolution satellite sensor IKONOS. During these 16years, significant technological improvements have been made both in space sensors as well in other non-contact remote sensing technologies, providing new tools for scientists to search the hidden past. The analysis presented here follows a citation based approach, where useful information is retrieved from the scientific literature. The paper visualises these trends by constructing science maps, based on bibliographic data of established research journals, found in Scopus, ScienceDirect and Web of Science (WoS) search engines. In addition, mapping and clustering analyses were carried out considering the Institutions that applied remote sensing technologies for archaeological purposes, thus providing a better insight and understanding of the current status of remote sensing archaeology in Europe. Time-stamped maps from 1999 until 2015 indicate on one hand that remote sensing technologies are widely accepted and applied by the archaeological community, but at the same time they make clear that substantial gaps still exist amongst European countries. Finally, the popularity of specific terms or the emergence of new terms in scientific literature through time is also presented, providing a synoptic view of the history and development of the remote sensing archaeology discipline. The discussion section analyses the gaps of the current study mainly due to “missing literature”. The paper underlines the need for the development of a common depository of all knowledge, acquired by the scientists operating in the field worldwide, to improve the “transfer of knowledge” and therefore harmonise the existing gap between the different scientific fields of remote sensing archaeology.},

	abstract = {Published ages of {\textgreater}50 ka for occupation at Madjedbebe (Malakunanja II) in Australia's north have kept the site prominent in discussions about the colonisation of Sahul. The site also contains one of the largest stone artefact assemblages in Sahul for this early period. However, the stone artefacts and other important archaeological components of the site have never been described in detail, leading to persistent doubts about its stratigraphic integrity. We report on our analysis of the stone artefacts and faunal and other materials recovered during the 1989 excavations, as well as the stratigraphy and depositional history recorded by the original excavators. We demonstrate that the technology and raw materials of the early assemblage are distinctive from those in the overlying layers. Silcrete and quartzite artefacts are common in the early assemblage, which also includes edge-ground axe fragments and ground haematite. The lower flaked stone assemblage is distinctive, comprising a mix of long convergent flakes, some radial flakes with faceted platforms, and many small thin silcrete flakes that we interpret as thinning flakes. Residue and use-wear analysis indicate occasional grinding of haematite and woodworking, as well as frequent abrading of platform edges on thinning flakes. We conclude that previous claims of extensive displacement of artefacts and post-depositional disturbance may have been overstated. The stone artefacts and stratigraphic details support previous claims for human occupation 50–60 ka and show that human occupation during this time differed from later periods. We discuss the implications of these new data for understanding the first human colonisation of Sahul.},

An archaeological case study is described that shows how each principle can be implemented using freely available software. The costs and benefits of implementing reproducible research are assessed. The primary benefit, of sharing data in particular, is increased impact via an increased number of citations. The primary cost is the additional time required to enhance reproducibility, although the exact amount is difficult to quantify.},

We explore this debate in light of recent efforts by many scientific disciplines to embrace methods to improve the reproducibility of their research. One of the most profound changes driven by this concern for reproducibility and transparency is from analysing data using tools dependent on point-and-clicking with a mouse in closed source software, to tools based on writing scripts in open source programming languages and making them openly available. We present bibliometric evidence for this change in ecology and in archaeology to test if the adoption of these new tools is revolutionary or transformational. We identify a positive citation effect for papers that use the open source programming language R.

It reports on the initial stages of work by the authors to build an extension to the CIDOC CRM ontology to accommodate concepts underlying the description of archaeological field survey data. We first constructed, based on our own experience as survey directors, a general process model for archaeological field survey; we then defined the concepts central to such survey practices in consultation with other domain experts; and we produced a draft conversion of these concepts into CIDOC CRM 'classes' with the help of members of the CRM Special Interest Group. While this work has resulted in a fairly robust conceptual model of field survey as practiced in the Mediterranean, we also identify and discuss several issues relating to the tension between the desire to enable comparative analysis of survey databases by improving documentation standards, and the apparent inability of the survey domain to achieve standardization of field procedures. Although the process of formally agreeing a CIDOC CRM extension for field survey is a slow one, we believe a global solution to the problem of comparability is worth pursuing over a local, temporary one. We lay out the steps needed to resolve the remaining conceptual issues, to formalise the CRM extension, and to implement it in the form of a 'mapping' tool.},

	abstract = {Airborne laser scanning (ALS) is a remote sensing technology known for its applicability in natural resources management. By quantifying the three-dimensional structure of vegetation and underlying terrain using laser technology, ALS has been used extensively for enhancing geospatial knowledge in the fields of forestry and ecology. Structural descriptions of vegetation provide a means of estimating a range of ecologically pertinent attributes, such as height, volume, and above-ground biomass. The efficient processing of large, often technically complex datasets requires dedicated algorithms and software. The continued promise of ALS as a tool for improving ecological understanding is often dependent on user-created tools, methods, and approaches. Due to the proliferation of ALS among academic, governmental, and private-sector communities, paired with requirements to address a growing demand for open and accessible data, the ALS community is recognising the importance of free and open-source software (FOSS) and the importance of user-defined workflows. Herein, we describe the philosophy behind the development of the lidR package. Implemented in the R environment with a C/C++ backend, lidR is free, open-source and cross-platform software created to enable simple and creative processing workflows for forestry and ecology communities using ALS data. We review current algorithms used by the research community, and in doing so raise awareness of current successes and challenges associated with parameterisation and common implementation approaches. Through a detailed description of the package, we address the key considerations and the design philosophy that enables users to implement user-defined tools. We also discuss algorithm choices that make the package representative of the ‘state-of-the-art’ and we highlight some internal limitations through examples of processing time discrepancies. We conclude that the development of applications like lidR are of fundamental importance for developing transparent, flexible and open ALS tools to ensure not only reproducible workflows, but also to offer researchers the creative space required for the progress and development of the discipline.},

However, the sheer amount of traces and of available high-quality data necessitates the use of computational methods for the automatic detection of these archaeological objects. Therefore, a novel approach, named CarcassonNet, has been developed that uses a combination of a Deep Learning convolutional neural network and image processing algorithms to detect and trace hollow roads in LiDAR data from the Netherlands. CarcassonNet has been specifically developed for the archaeological domain, focusing on being computationally light and suited for reconstructing partially preserved and intersected hollow roads. Instead of using the whole roads as input for the convolutional neural network, in CarcassonNet individual sections are used. This makes it much more cost-effective to create a sufficient training dataset, and makes the classification task (performed by the neural network) relatively simple, with better detection results. The output of CarcassonNet consists of two types of geospatial vectors that offer the opportunity to efficiently study the roads themselves and their precise location in the landscape (polygons), and the course of the roads and the resulting route network (lines). An experimental evaluation shows that CarcassonNet is able to effectively detect hollow roads, with a MCC score of 0.47. Furthermore, it is shown that using the Digital Terrain Model, instead of visualized LiDAR data (hillshade) improves the performance of the convolutional neural network. The results of this research offer opportunities to reconstruct vanished and abandoned (post)medieval routes and answer questions about human-landscape interactions.},

As a consequence, the choice between these visualization techniques is still mostly supported by empirical knowledge. Some attempts have been made to compare these techniques, but there is still a lack of analytical data. This work proposes a new method, based on gradient modelling and spatial statistics, to analytically assess the efficacy of these visualization techniques. A selected panel of outstanding visualization techniques was assessed first by a classic non-analytical approach, and secondly by the proposed new analytical approach. The comparison of results showed that the latter provided more detailed and objective data, not always consistent with previous empirical knowledge. These data allowed us to characterize with precision the terrain for which each visualization technique performs best. A combination of visualization techniques based on DEM manipulation (Slope and Local Relief Model) appeared to be the best choice for normal terrain morphometry, occasionally supported by illumination techniques such as Sky-View Factor or Negative Openness as a function of terrain characteristics.},

	abstract = {Morphological analysis of landforms has traditionally relied on the interpretation of imagery. Although imagery provides a natural view of an area of interest (AOI) images are largely hindered by the environmental conditions at the time of image acquisition, the quality of the image and, mainly, the lack of topographical information, which is an essential factor for a correct understanding of the AOI's geomorphology. More recently digital surface models (DSMs) have been incorporated into the analytical toolbox of geomorphologists. These are usually high-resolution models derived from digital photogrammetric processes or LiDAR data. However, these are restricted to relatively small areas and are expensive or complex to acquire, which limits widespread implementation. In this paper, we present the multi-scale relief model (MSRM), which is a new algorithm for the visual interpretation of landforms using DSMs. The significance of this new method lies in its capacity to extract landform morphology from both high- and low-resolution DSMs independently of the shape or scale of the landform under study. This method thus provides important advantages compared to previous approaches as it: (1) allows the use of worldwide medium resolution models, such as SRTM, ASTER GDEM, ALOS, and TanDEM-X; (2) offers an alternative to traditional photograph interpretation that does not rely on the quality of the imagery employed nor on the environmental conditions and time of its acquisition; and (3) can be easily implemented for large areas using traditional GIS/RS software. The algorithm is tested in the Sutlej-Yamuna interfluve, which is a very large low-relief alluvial plain in northwest India where 10 000 km of palaeoriver channels have been mapped using MSRM. The code, written in Google Earth Engine's implementation of JavaScript, is provided as Supporting Information for its use in any other AOI without particular technical knowledge or access to topographical data. © 2017 The Authors.

	abstract = {Airborne LiDAR technology is widely used in archaeology and over the past decade has emerged as an accurate tool to describe anthropomorphic landforms. Archaeological features are traditionally emphasised on a LiDAR-derived Digital Terrain Model (DTM) using multiple Visualisation Techniques (VTs), and occasionally aided by automated feature detection or classification techniques. Such an approach offers limited results when applied to heterogeneous structures (different sizes, morphologies), which is often the case for archaeological remains that have been altered throughout the ages. This study proposes to overcome these limitations by developing a multi-scale analysis of topographic position combined with supervised machine learning algorithms (Random Forest). Rather than highlighting individual topographic anomalies, the multi-scalar approach allows archaeological features to be examined not only as individual objects, but within their broader spatial context. This innovative and straightforward method provides two levels of results: a composite image of topographic surface structure and a probability map of the presence of archaeological structures. The method was developed to detect and characterise megalithic funeral structures in the region of Carnac, the Bay of Quiberon, and the Gulf of Morbihan (France), which is currently considered for inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage List. As a result, known archaeological sites have successfully been geo-referenced with a greater accuracy than before (even when located under dense vegetation) and a ground-check confirmed the identification of a previously unknown Neolithic burial mound in the commune of Carnac.},

Among the features revealed by the LiDAR are a profusion of earthen mounds, most of which are associated with residence, sporting, or burial in the period 1000–1850 CE. For identification and mapping of the mounds we use and evaluate two automated feature extraction (AFE) techniques, object-based image analysis and an inverted pit-filling algorithm (“iMound”). Accuracy of these methods was measured using an F1-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall). Variable AFE results indicate that continual and iterative fine-tuning is required.

In order to record the topography of this area, the first ever scientific airborne LiDAR data acquisition in Lebanon was conducted in autumn 2018. This work describes not only the acquisition and processing of the LiDAR data, but also the attempt to derive possible archaeological sites from the generated elevation model based on methods for spatial analysis. Using an “inverted mound” (iMound) algorithm, areas of possible settlement structures could be identified, which were classified regarding their probability of a possible ancient site using a deductive predictive model. A preliminary validation of some of the detected favoured areas using high-resolution aerial images has shown that the methods applied can provide hints to previously undiscovered sites. It was possible to identify probable ancient wall remains at several detected locations. In addition, least-cost path analyses were performed to reconstruct possible trade and transport routes from the Lebanon Mountains to the Mediterranean coast. The combination of the results of the iMound detection and classification as well as the calculated path system could point to the strategic location of the modern village of Kfar Hazir as a kind of traffic junction. Moreover, reconstructed main transport routes provide indications of heavily frequented roads and may form the basis for further investigations. To validate the results, upcoming field surveys will be realized on site.},

I present a methodology through which burial mounds (tumuli) from LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) DEMS can be identified. This methodology uses geomorphometric and statistical methods to identify with high accuracy burial mound candidates. Peaks, defined as local elevation maxima are found as a first step. In the second step, local convexity watershed segments and their seeds are compared with positions of local peaks and the peaks that correspond or have in vicinity local convexity segments seeds are selected. The local convexity segments that correspond to these selected peaks are further fed to a Random Forest algorithm together with shape descriptors and descriptive statistics of geomorphometric variables in order to build a model for the classification. Multiple approaches to tune and select the proper training dataset, settings, and variables were tested. The validation of the model was performed on the full dataset where the training was performed and on an external dataset in order to test the usability of the method for other areas in a similar geomorphological and archaeological setting. The validation was performed against manually mapped, and field checked burial mounds from two neighbor study areas of 100 km2 each. The results show that by training the Random Forest on a dataset composed of between 75\% and 100\% of the segments corresponding to burial mounds and ten times more non-burial mounds segments selected using Latin hypercube sampling, 93\% of the burial mound segments from the external dataset are identified. There are 42 false positive cases that need to be checked, and there are two burial mound segments missed. The method shows great promise to be used for burial mound detection on wider areas by delineating a certain number of tumuli mounds for model training.},

In this paper, the predictive power of Generalized Linear Models (GLM) versus Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) models of plant distribution in the Spring Mountains of Nevada, USA, are compared. Results show that GLM models give better predictions than CCA models because a species-specific subset of explanatory variables can be selected in GLM, while in CCA, all species are modeled using the same set of composite environmental variables (axes). Although both techniques can be readily ported to a Geographical Information System (GIS), CCA models are more readily implemented for many species at once. Predictions from both techniques rank the species models in the same order of quality; i.e. a species whose distribution is well modeled by GLM is also well modeled by CCA and vice-versa. In both cases, species for which model predictions have the poorest accuracy are either disturbance or fire related, or species for which too few observations were available to calibrate and evaluate the model. Each technique has its advantages and drawbacks. In general GLM will provide better species specific-models, but CCA will provide a broader overview of multiple species, diversity, and plant communities.},

	abstract = {Digital elevation model (DEM) derived measures of terrain ruggedness and relative topographic position are useful parameters for automated landform classification and are widely applied in soils, vegetation, and habitat mapping. These elevation residual attributes are inherently scale dependent because they are defined in the context of a local neighborhood. Several previous studies have focused on assessing the multi-scale properties of elevation residuals based on varying roving window sizes, DEM grid resolution resampling, and hierarchical object-based methods. The computationally intensive nature of large-window DEM filtering has previously prevented the application of the varying roving window size approach from being applied to study the scaling properties of the terrain ruggedness and topographic position at broader regional scales. This paper explores the use of an integral image based approach to measuring the common relative topographic position metric deviation from mean elevation (DEV). The approach was applied to a large DEM of an extensive and heterogeneous region in eastern North America. Compared with traditional image filtering techniques, the integral image approach was extremely efficient for calculating DEV, enabling a fine-resolution multi-scale analysis of elevation residuals. A method is described to allow for the measurement of DEV at optimal scales for each grid cell within wide spatial scale ranges. A novel technique is also developed for visualizing the scaling characteristics of topographic position using color composite imagery.},

These were described by the Chinese envoy Zhou Daguan, who visited Angkor in the late thirteenth century ad. His account includes the important information that each cistern was used by one to three families. The validity of this historical account can now be assessed using a precise map of the archaeological landscape that was created in 2012 using airborne laser scanning (‘ALS’ or ‘LiDAR’, light detection and ranging). The LiDAR data allow us to arrive at new insights into the demography of medieval Angkor. Using an algorithm for semi-automatic pond detection in the ALS-derived data it was possible to map over three thousand cisterns and from this to make inferences about population density in central Angkor.

	abstract = {Identification and removal of surface depressions is a critical step for automated modelling of surface rainfall runoff based on Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). At present, nearly all GIS and hydrologic software packages employ Jenson and Domingue's method for preparing depressionless DEMs for hydrologic analysis. This conventional method is computationally intensive and time‐consuming. With the growing availability of high‐resolution DEMs produced by airborne LIDAR and InSAR techniques, GIS‐based hydrologic applications often need to handle larger geographic areas at finer resolutions. In the face of high‐resolution DEMs, the conventional method becomes inadequate and deficient. In this paper, we present a new method for efficiently identifying and filling surface depressions in DEMs. This method can simultaneously determine flow paths and spatial partition of watersheds with one pass of processing. A novel concept of spill elevation and the least‐cost search for optimal flow paths are the two cornerstones of our method. The time complexity of our method is in O(Nlog N). It has been implemented using C++ programming language and successfully applied to USGS DEMs and LIDAR DEMs of various sizes. Experiments show that our method outperforms the conventional method by a factor of over 30, in terms of running time.},

	abstract = {The usual numerical methods for removing the depressions of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) gradually fill the depressions and merge the embedded ones. These methods are complex to implement and need large computation time, particularly when the DEM contains a high proportion of random noise. A new method is presented here. It is innovative because, instead of gradually filling the depressions, it first inundates the surface with a thick layer of water and then removes the excess water. The algorithm is simple to understand and to implement, requiring only a few tens of code lines. It is much faster than usual algorithms. Moreover, this method is versatile: depressions can be replaced with a surface either strictly horizontal, or slightly sloping. The first option is used for the calculation of depression storage capacity and the second one for drainage network extraction. The method is fully detailed and a pseudo-code is provided. Its practical computation time, evaluated on generated fractal surfaces, is asymptotically proportional to N1.2 where N is the number of grid points. The theoretical computation time is asymptotically proportional to N1.5 in all cases, with the exception of some exotic ones with no practical interest. By contrast, existing methods have a computation time asymptotically proportional to N2. Applications are done for both generated and measured surfaces with 256 cells to 6.2 million cells.},

It is noted that through the twentieth century most applications of remote sensing to archaeology have involved data from one remote sensing platform at a time.

The SRTM model provides for the first time an opportunity to scan areas not yet surveyed archaeologically on a supra-regional scale and to pinpoint probable tell sites. In order to map these historic monuments for the purpose of settlement-study and conservation, we develop a machine learning classifier which identifies probable tell sites from the terrain model. In a test, point-like elevations of a characteristic tell shape, standing out for more than 5 to 6 m in the DEM were successfully detected (85/133 tells). False positives (327/(600*1200) pixels) were primarily due to natural elevations, resembling tells in height and size.},

Mounding is a characteristic property of these settlement sites, resulting from millennia of continuing settlement activity at distinguished places. So far, however, this defining feature of ancient settlements has not received much attention, or even been the subject of systematic evaluation. We propose a remote sensing approach for comprehensively mapping the pattern of human settlement at large scale and establish the largest archaeological record for a landscape in Mesopotamia, mapping about 14,000 settlement sites—spanning eight millennia—at 15-m resolution in a 23,000-km2 area in northeastern Syria. To map both low- and high-mounded places—the latter of which are often referred to as “tells”—we develop a strategy for detecting anthrosols in time series of multispectral satellite images and measure the volume of settlement sites in a digital elevation model. Using this volume as a proxy to continued occupation, we find a dependency of the long-term attractiveness of a site on local water availability, but also a strong relation to the relevance within a basin-wide exchange network that we can infer from our record and third millennium B.C. intersite routes visible on the ground until recent times. We believe it is possible to establish a nearly comprehensive map of human settlements in the fluvial plains of northern Mesopotamia and beyond, and site volume may be a key quantity to uncover long-term trends in human settlement activity from such a record.},

In this chapter we briefly review the multi- and hyper-spectral remote sensing approaches that have been used in archaeological survey in the Near East, and report on a novel satellite remote sensing approach we recently developed. This approach recognizes anthropogenic sediments via scenes from multi-spectral ASTER images using a multi-temporal classification strategy, guided from results of a visual inspection of CORONA images. We apply it to the Khabur Basin, in north-eastern Syria, returning a probabilistic map of anthrosols that is indicating the locations of some 10,000 settlement sites of all times – from the eighth millennium B.C. to modern – at a resolution of 15 m for an area of about 22,000 km2 and with an accuracy that is comparable to modern ground survey. This makes it, to the best of our knowledge, the largest systematic satellite imagery based survey in archaeology. Our multi-temporal classification strategy can integrate information from any other multi- or hyper-spectral sensor, and it will easily generalize to other related detection tasks in archaeological remote sensing.},

The integer scores range from 1 to 6. By using mound templates with gradually increasing radii from 1.0 to 16m, the method is able to detect all mounds in this range, provided they are visible and well-formed in the DTM. Despite a high number of false positives, the method is a useful tool in semi-automatic, detailed mapping of known grave fields, especially when the number of ground points per square metre is sufficiently large. The method is also able to identify the location of a previously unknown grave field. We discuss possible improvements of the method. The highest potential for better detection performance is in ALS acquisition in the early spring or the late autumn, when leaves are not present.},

This study examines semi-automated approaches to identification of archaeological features through a comparison of pixel-based and object-oriented data classification methods for archaeological feature detection in visualizations derived from high-resolution airborne laser scanning data. In doing so, openness is presented as a suitable visualization for feature detection due to its illumination-invariant representation of convexity and concavity in terrain data. The methodology of both pixel-based and object-oriented data classification approaches is described and applied to two datasets recorded over two archeological case study areas in Sweden and Austria. The diverse nature of the two datasets makes them ideal with regard to determining the robustness of the approaches discussed here. The obtained results are exported to a GIS environment and compared with manual visual interpretations and analyzed in terms of their accuracy. Therefore, this paper presents both a discussion regarding the merits of pixel- and object-based semi-automated classification strategies with regard to archaeological prospection data as well as practical examples of their implementation and results.},

There are three major strengths in the proposed methodology: 1) the use of supercomputing (High Performance Computing) for the analysis of topographical information, 2) the development of own specific code, and 3) the use of accurate topographic descriptors for terrain analysis. The method is able to provide concrete locations that can eventually match the theoretical morphometric features of this kind of sepulchres.

Using publicly available lidar data from Beaufort County, South Carolina, and an OBIA approach that incorporates morphometric classification and statistical template matching, we systematically identify over 160 previously undetected mound features.

	abstract = {Airborne LiDAR technology is widely used in archaeology and over the past decade has emerged as an accurate tool to describe anthropomorphic landforms. Archaeological features are traditionally emphasised on a LiDAR-derived Digital Terrain Model (DTM) using multiple Visualisation Techniques (VTs), and occasionally aided by automated feature detection or classification techniques. Such an approach offers limited results when applied to heterogeneous structures (different sizes, morphologies), which is often the case for archaeological remains that have been altered throughout the ages. This study proposes to overcome these limitations by developing a multi-scale analysis of topographic position combined with supervised machine learning algorithms (Random Forest). Rather than highlighting individual topographic anomalies, the multi-scalar approach allows archaeological features to be examined not only as individual objects, but within their broader spatial context. This innovative and straightforward method provides two levels of results: a composite image of topographic surface structure and a probability map of the presence of archaeological structures. The method was developed to detect and characterise megalithic funeral structures in the region of Carnac, the Bay of Quiberon, and the Gulf of Morbihan (France), which is currently considered for inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage List. As a result, known archaeological sites have successfully been geo-referenced with a greater accuracy than before (even when located under dense vegetation) and a ground-check confirmed the identification of a previously unknown Neolithic burial mound in the commune of Carnac.},

	abstract = {One persistent archaeological challenge is the generation of systematic documentation for the extant archaeological record at the scale of landscapes. Often our information for landscapes is the result of haphazard and patchy surveys that stem from opportunistic and historic efforts. Consequently, overall knowledge of some regions is the product of ad hoc survey area delineation, degree of accessibility, effective ground visibility, and the fraction of areas that have survived destruction from development. These factors subsequently contribute unknown biases to our understanding of chronology, settlements patterns, interaction, and exchange. Aerial remote sensing offers one potential solution for improving our knowledge of landscapes. With sensors that include LiDAR, remote sensing can identify archaeological features that are otherwise obscured by vegetation. Object-based image analyses (OBIA) of remote sensing data hold particular promise to facilitate regional analyses thorough the automation of archaeological feature recognition. Here, we explore four OBIA algorithms for artificial mound feature detection using LiDAR from Beaufort County, South Carolina: multiresolution segmentation, inverse depression analysis, template matching, and a newly designed algorithm that combines elements of segmentation and template matching. While no single algorithm proved to be consistently superior to the others, a combination of methods is shown to be the most effective for detecting archaeological features.},

Therefore, geographers and archaeologists from Westphalia, Germany are developing automated workflows for classifying field monuments from special terrain models. For this project, a combination of GIS, Python, and Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) is used. It focuses on three common types of monuments: Ridge and Furrow areas, Burial Mounds, and Motte-and-Bailey castles. The latter two are not classified binary, but in multiple classes, depending on their degree of erosion. This simplifies interpretation by highlighting the most interesting structures without losing the others. The results confirm that OBIA is suitable for detecting field monuments with hit rates of {\textasciitilde}90\%. A drawback is its dependency on the use of special terrain models like the Difference Map. Further limitations arise in complex terrain situations.},

In this paper, a promising new technique for the automated detection of multiple classes of archaeological objects in LiDAR data is presented. This technique is based on R-CNNs (Regions-based Convolutional Neural Networks). Unlike normal CNNs, which classify the entire input image, R-CNNs address the problem of object detection, which requires correctly localising and classifying (multiple) objects within a larger image. We have incorporated this technique into a workflow, which enables the preprocessing of LiDAR data into the required data format and the conversion of the results of the object detection into geographical data, usable in a GIS environment. The proposed technique has been trained and tested on LiDAR data gathered from the central part of the Netherlands. This area contains a multitude of archaeological objects, including prehistoric barrows and Celtic fields. The initial experiments show that we are able to automatically detect and categorise these two types of archaeological objects and thus proof the added value of this technique.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an innovative multisensor, multitemporal machine-learning approach using remote sensing big data for the detection of archaeological mounds in Cholistan (Pakistan). The Cholistan Desert presents one of the largest concentrations of Indus Civilization sites (from ca. 3300 to 1500 BC). Cholistan has figured prominently in theories about changes in water availability, the rise and decline of the Indus Civilization, and the transformation of fertile monsoonal alluvial plains into an extremely arid margin. This paper implements a multisensor, multitemporal machine-learning approach for the remote detection of archaeological mounds. A classifier algorithm that employs a large-scale collection of synthetic-aperture radar and multispectral images has been implemented in Google Earth Engine, resulting in an accurate probability map for mound-like signatures across an area that covers ca. 36,000 km2. The results show that the area presents many more archaeological mounds than previously recorded, extending south and east into the desert, which has major implications for understanding the archaeological significance of the region. The detection of small ({\textless}5 ha) to large mounds ({\textgreater}30 ha) suggests that there were continuous shifts in settlement location. These shifts are likely to reflect responses to a dynamic and changing hydrological network and the influence of the progressive northward advance of the desert in a long-term process that culminated in the abandonment of much of the settled area during the Late Harappan period.},

	abstract = {Located in the northern part of the Tian Shan Mountains, at an average elevation of over 2200 m.a.s.l., the Suusamyr Plateau is home to numerous archaeological sites. Nonetheless, there is little to no information available regarding the spatial characteristics and preservation conditions of these complex burial grounds. During the recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have offered the possibility of fast acquisition of high-resolution images that facilitate the identification and documentation of archaeological sites and features. Given these advantages over 1500 ha (29 individual sites) were investigated within the Suusamyr Plateau, using a DJI Phantom 4 Pro quadcopter. Based on the UAV derived dataset, over 600 burial mounds were identified via manual mapping. However, as this is a time consuming and subjective process, a new method that integrates the multi-scale topographic analysis and the geomorphons approach is introduced here for the semi-automated extraction of burial mounds. Following an object-based image analysis (OBIA) routine, the proposed methodology was developed within a single site (T1), while the transferability degree of the final model was subsequently assessed within two other investigated sites (T2, T3). The accuracy of the obtained model was determined using the F1-Score (harmonic mean of precision and recall). The highest detection rate of 100\% was achieved for test site T2, while the lowest value of 87.5\% was obtained for site T3.},

	abstract = {Automated recognition of terrain structures is a major research problem in many application areas. These structures can be investigated in raster products such as Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) generated from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data. Following the success of deep learning and computer vision techniques on color images, researchers have focused on the application of such techniques in their respective fields. One example is detection of structures in DEM data. DEM data can be used to train deep learning models, but recently, Du et al. (2019) proposed a multi-modal deep learning approach (hereafter referred to as MM) proving that combination of geomorphological information help improve the performance of deep learning models. They reported that combining DEM, slope, and RGB-shaded relief gives the best result among other combinations consisting of curvature, flow accumulation, topographic wetness index, and grey-shaded relief. In this work, we approve and build on top of this approach. First, we use MM and show that combinations of other information such as sky view factors, (simple) local relief models, openness, and local dominance improve model performance even further. Secondly, based on the recently proposed HR-Net (Sun et al., 2019), we build a tinier, Multi-Modal High Resolution network called MM-HR, that outperforms MM. MM-HR learns with fewer parameters (4 millions), and gives an accuracy of 84:2 percent on ZISM50m data compared to 79:2 percent accuracy by MM which learns with more parameters (11 millions). On the dataset of archaeological mining structures from Harz, the top accuracy by MM-HR is 91:7 percent compared to 90:2 by MM.},

	abstract = {The existing cultural heritage mapping in Norway is incomplete. Some selected areas are mapped well, while the majority of areas only contain chance discoveries, often with bad positional accuracy. The goal of this research was to develop automated tools for improving the cultural heritage mapping in Norway, thus enabling detailed mapping of large areas within realistic budgets and time frames. The focus was on three types of cultural heritage that occur frequently in many types of Norwegian landscape: grave mounds, pitfall traps in deer hunting systems and charcoal kilns. A recent development in deep neural networks for object detection in natural images is the region-proposing convolutional neural network (R-CNN), which may also be used for cultural heritage detection in local relief model (LRM) visualizations of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. Python code for ‘Simple Faster R-CNN’ was downloaded from Github. On 737 test images (16.6 km2) not seen during training, 87 \% of the true cultural heritage objects were correctly identified, while 24 \% of the predicted cultural heritage locations were false. However, all test images were small (150 m × 150 m) and contained at least one cultural heritage object, meaning that the false positive rate may be higher for an entire landscape. In Larvik municipality, Vestfold and Telemark County, on a 67 km2 area not seen during training, the R-CNN correctly identified 38 \% of the true grave mounds, with 89 \% false positives. On a 937 km2 area covering Øvre Eiker municipality, Viken County, the R-CNN correctly identified 90 \% of the charcoal kilns, with 38 \% false positives. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that Faster R-CNN is well suited for semi-automatic detection of cultural heritage objects such as charcoal kilns, grave mounds and pitfall traps in high resolution airborne lidar data. However, it is desirable to reduce the false positive rate in order to limit the amount of visual inspection needed when the method is applied to large areas for detailed archaeological mapping.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, remote sensing and satellite images are used instead of field operations required to identify cultural heritage and antiquities due to the capability of analysis of altitude, temperature, vegetation, moisture content, and soil type. On the other hand, remote sensing requires less cost and time compared to field operations and can provide more accurate results with more certainty. In this study, optical and thermal images of Landsat 8 were used in the winter and summer seasons in Farahan historical area in Iran. The data were fused with different methods of data fusion at the pixel level, and their results were compared with four validation methods. Among the used fusion methods, the Ehlers showed the best performance. All images were then fused with this method, and their results were entered into the next steps of the processes. In order to extract ancient structures and hills, their spectral and geometric properties were studied. Therefore, in order to investigate spectral properties of ancient hills, the effects of old structures on moisture content, clay content, lime content, greenness, and land surface temperature (LST) were studied. This led to the production of five information layers. These five layers were classified with unsupervised classification algorithms in different classes. Then, for distinguishing between ancient hills and other ancient structures, their salient geometric features “altitude anomaly” were studied. To do this, a map of the promising areas of the existence of ancient structures was integrated with the altitude anomalies map which is obtained from applying a range filter on a DEM with a resolution of 10 m. Finally, the ancient hills were extracted into three different categories, using the template matching algorithm, taking into account the correlation coefficient. The best value of the correlation coefficient that was used to detect the ancient hills in the first 10 identified cases of the first group was between 75 and 80\%. This value was 40\% for the second group of the ancient hills, which caused 80\% correct identification of the hills. Also, for third group of the ancient hills, it was between 30 and 35\% which caused 70\% correct identification of the ancient hills.},

Here, we use deep learning, a form of machine intelligence, to detect shell ring deposits and identify their geographic range in LiDAR data from South Carolina. We corroborate our results using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), multispectral data, and a random forest analysis. We conclude that a greater number of shell rings exist and that their distribution expanded further north than currently documented. Our evidence suggests that ring-construction was a more widespread and common practice during the mid-Holocene.},

	abstract = {“Tells” are archaeological mounds formed by deposition of large amounts of anthropogenic material and sediments over thousands of years and are the most important and prominent features in Near and Middle Eastern archaeological landscapes. In the last decade, archaeologists have exploited free-access global digital elevation model (DEM) datasets at medium resolution (i.e., up to 30 m) to map tells on a supra-regional scale and pinpoint tentative tell sites. Instead, the potential of satellite DEMs at higher resolution for this task was yet to be demonstrated. To this purpose, the 3 m resolution imaging capability allowed by the Italian Space Agency’s COSMO-SkyMed Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) constellation in StripMap HIMAGE mode was used in this study to generate DEM products of enhanced resolution to undertake, for the first time, a systematic mapping of tells and archaeological deposits. The demonstration is run at regional scale in the Governorate of Wasit in central Iraq, where the literature suggested a high density of sites, despite knowledge gaps about their location and spatial distribution. Accuracy assessment of the COSMO-SkyMed DEM is provided with respect to the most commonly used SRTM and ALOS World 3D DEMs. Owing to the 10 m posting and the consequent enhanced observation capability, the COSMO-SkyMed DEM proves capable to detect both well preserved and levelled or disturbed tells, standing out for more than 4 m from the surrounding landscape. Through the integration with CORONA KH-4B tiles, 1950s Soviet maps and recent Sentinel-2 multispectral images, the expert-led visual identification and manual mapping in the GIS environment led to localization of tens of sites that were not previously mapped, alongside the computation of a figure as up-to-date as February 2019 of the survived tells, with those affected by looting. Finally, this evidence is used to recognize hot-spot areas of potential concern for the conservation of tells. To this purpose, we upgraded the spatial resolution of the observations up to 1 m by using the Enhanced Spotlight mode to collect a bespoke time series. The change detection tests undertaken on selected clusters of disturbed tells prove how a dedicated monitoring activity may allow a regular observation of the impacts due to anthropogenic disturbance (e.g., road and canal constructions or ploughing).},

Die manuelle Lokalisation und Kartierung von archäologischen Informationen einer Kulturlandschaft ist in der herkömmlichen Herangehensweise eine sehr zeitaufwändige Aufgabe des Fundstellenmanagements (Cultural Heritage Management). Um die Möglichkeiten in der Erkennung und bei der Verwaltung des kulturellem Erbes zu verbessern und zu ergänzen, können computergestützte Verfahren einige neue Lösungsansätze bieten, die darüber hinaus sogar die Identifizierung von für das menschliche Auge bei visueller Sichtung nicht erkennbaren Details ermöglichen. Aus archäologischer Sicht ist die vorliegende Dissertation dadurch motiviert, dass sie LIDAR-Geländemodelle mit archäologischen Befunden durch automatisierte und semiautomatisierte Methoden zur Identifizierung weiterer archäologischer Muster zu Bodendenkmalen als digitale „LIDAR-Landschaft“ bewertet. Dabei wird auf möglichst einfache und freie verfügbare algorithmische Ansätze (Open Source) aus der Bildmustererkennung und Computer Vision zur Segmentierung und Klassifizierung der LIDAR-Landschaften zur großflächigen Erkennung archäologischer Denkmäler zurückgegriffen. Die Dissertation gibt dabei einen umfassenden Überblick über die archäologische Nutzung und das Potential von LIDAR-Daten und definiert anhand qualitativer und quantitativer Ansätze den Entwicklungsstand der semiautomatisierten Erkennung archäologischer Strukturen im Rahmen archäologischer Prospektion und Fernerkundungen. Darüber hinaus erläutert sie Best Practice-Beispiele und den einhergehenden aktuellen Forschungsstand. Und sie veranschaulicht die Qualität der Erkennung von Bodendenkmälern durch die semiautomatisierte Segmentierung und Klassifizierung visualisierter LIDAR-Daten. Letztlich identifiziert sie das Feld für weitere Anwendungen, wobei durch eigene, algorithmische Template Matching-Verfahren großflächige Untersuchungen zum kulturellen Erbe ermöglicht werden. Resümierend vergleicht sie die analoge und computergestützte Bildmustererkennung zu Bodendenkmalen, und diskutiert abschließend das weitere Potential LIDAR-basierter Mustererkennung in archäologischen Kulturlandschaften.},

	url = {http://www.nwmissouri.edu/library/theses/2009/RileyMelanie.pdf},
	abstract = {The Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) and partnering agencies are
conducting a statewide LiDAR data collection project. A 1 m shaded relief image from
an early collection clearly displayed a recorded, prehistoric mound group on IDNR
property, except for a set of three mounds overshadowed from a nearby hill. Prehistoric
burial mounds are protected from disturbance through several federal and state laws.
Unfortunately, the State Archaeologist and State Historic Preservation Offices do not
have the resources to conduct mound surveys throughout the state for the sake of
knowing what areas should be protected from future development. LiDAR introduces the
possibility that large-area mound prospection is feasible.
There are challenges to image interpretation that can make such a task time-consuming
with potentially mixed results. Conical mounds visible on shaded relief images are as
small as 5 m diameter and 30 cm high. Interpretation over large areas can become tedious
and may affect the quality and consistency of the interpretation over time. The
interpreter’s experience and ability to detect subtle changes in shading also impact
interpretation quality. The early relief image demonstrated that more than one image with
different settings will be necessary to interpret areas that are overshadowed.
iiiA conical mound detection model was developed in the ArcGIS 9.2 ModelBuilder
environment using Spatial Analyst tools. The model works as an interpretation aid by
marking features that fit the metrics of the most common mound type. ArcGIS is the
prevalent GIS software used by archaeologist in the state and the model, stored as a .tbx
file, is easily distributable. The base of the model relies on three variables derived from
the BE DEM – height, slope and aspect variety. An additional segment of the model is for
clean-up and conversion from the raster data model to vector.
The model was tested in five areas representing three physiographic regions; it detected
90\% of mounds that were interpretable from shaded relief images and have been recently
field-verified, including other mound types. The model reduced the area to be checked to
0.15\% - 0.4\% of the area of interest. Natural and man-made features that triggered false
positives were consistent; future work will be directed towards reducing the occurrences.
The model can expedite prospection of counties with high mound densities to the point
where the time required for such a project would fit a modest budget. The results of the
interpretation can be disseminated through an Internet Map Service (IMS) already
established for professional archaeologists. County planners and local governments could
get the results to the quarter section through an IMS currently in development, giving
them warning that a potential prehistoric burial may be in a planned project area.},

	abstract = {The increasing amounts and variety within remote sensing data have triggered researchers to develop semi-automated methods for detecting landscape features. For archaeology it has been recognised that it is difficult to capture the unique characteristics of archaeological remains detected in the landscape. This has led to a discussion of the potential from which was concluded that variable features could not be captured. Nonetheless within geosciences recent success of pattern recognition allowed for the supervised classification of highly irregular landslides using cognitive reasoning and machine learning. These concepts form the basis of artificial intelligence (AI) which has yet to be explored for remote sensing in archaeology. The success in geoscience is largely provided by the geographical object based image analysis software, eCognition, which has been explored by archaeologists to some extent but was not applied in great detail. With the presentation of a pilot study for barrow recognition around Avebury, United Kingdom, it has been shown that the potential of this software is far reaching and requires a re-evaluation within the archaeological discipline for remote sensing. From three basic analysis based on cognitive ruleset, template matching and machine learning it was concluded that the first is simple to implement but requires a lot of manual refinement and with the second, simple and consistent features could be detected. Even though the machine learning algorithm did not yield the best results it is a known fact that with adequate amounts of training data, this is the best method to detect variable features as it writes the rules itself based on similarities between training samples. As it was shown that AI concepts are able to detect unique characteristics of archaeological features and combine multiple remote sensing layers to do so it was found that the future of semi-automated pattern recognition in archaeological remote sensing could greatly aid large scale mapping programmes. Additionally, these methods could be applied for change detection to monitor archaeological sites for improved heritage management and have the potential to be widely implemented in an all-encompassing online web application for exchange of rulesets and training data for generally known features.},

	abstract = {Archaeology has always benefited from methods of other disciplines: computer applications and quantitative analysis techniques have been applied by archaeologists since the 1970's to analyze and interpret archaeological data. Some methods have been accepted faster and smoother than others. Developments in Computational Science - more precisely Computer Vision have revolutionised data handling and analysis in disciplines like Physical Geography, Environmental Informatics and Remote Sensing and hold out very promising possibilities especially for data-driven archaeological use which is in need of elaborate methods to be able to handle archaeological big data which is becoming more complex. Nowadays machine learning itself and methods like pattern recognition, feature extraction are still being treated novercal and haven't found a really wide acceptance and understanding in archaeological research. Understanding is an important codeword: we have to understand what the method we plan to use can give us, if the chosen method is suitable for our research question and how we can refine, “tune” and validate our model. This paper would like to compare several machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Neuronal Networks, Classification and Regression Trees, Linear Discriminant Analysis and k-Nearest Neighbour) and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. All algorithms will be used on the same dataset (LiDAR data of the region around the Dünsberg, Germany), research question (the detection of burial mounds and enclosures) and in the same scripting language (R) to be able to compare them to each other.},

The application of these new methods to Archaeology has benefits as well as limitations. These new methods are not going to or should replace the “classical” archaeological methods, like manual analysis or field-surveys or even human input in general. What new methods can do is to lend a hand to deal with big amounts of data in ways which are inaccessible to “normal” observers. We also have to bear in mind that these new methods are still evolving and it is a long way to understand how and if they can be applied to Archaeology.

Established approaches to archaeological interpretation of aerial photographs are heavily reliant on individual observation (eye/brain) in an experience and knowledge-based process. Increasingly, however, much more complex and extensive datasets are becoming available to archaeology and these require critical reflection on analytical and interpretative processes. Archaeological applications of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) are becoming increasingly routine, and as the spatial resolution of hyper-spectral data improves, its potentially massive implications for archaeological site detection may prove to be a sea-change. These complex datasets demand new approaches, as traditional methods based on direct observation by an archaeological interpreter will never do more than scratch the surface, and will fail to fully extend the boundaries of knowledge. Inevitably, changing analytical and interpretative processes can create tensions, especially, as has been the case in archaeology, when the innovations in data and analysis come from outside the discipline. These tensions often centre on the character of the information produced, and a lack of clarity on the place of archaeological interpretation in the workflow. This is especially true for ALS data and autoextraction techniques, and carries implications for all forms of remote sensed archaeological datasets, including hyperspectral data and aerial photographs.},

Nevertheless, the progression of automated computational approaches is limited by distinct geographic imbalances in where these techniques are developed and applied. Here, I investigate the degree of this disparity and some potential reasons for this imbalance. Analyses from Web of Science and Microsoft Academic searches reveal that there is a substantial difference between the Global North and South in the output of machine intelligence remote sensing archaeology literature.
